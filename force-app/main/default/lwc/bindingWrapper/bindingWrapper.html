        <p>
            In LWC, property binding is unidirectional. To send values from view (HTML) to controller (JS), use standard HTML events. Properties can also be used to pass information down, but 
            not up. To pass information up, use custom events. For instance, lightning-input passes information
            up using the payload of the change event it fires. Another important difference is that Visualforce is rendered on the server side.
            This means that a server roundtrip is required to update the property whereas, in LWC, rendering happens on the client-side. In LWC, the view is automatically rerendered when a JS property value changes.
