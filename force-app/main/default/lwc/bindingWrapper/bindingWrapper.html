        <p>
            In LWC, property binding is unidirectional. Properties are used to pass information down, but 
            not up. To pass information up, use HTML events. For instance, lightning-input passes information
            up firing a change event (information is carried in the payload of the event!).
            To listen to an event that an element fires, define a handler in JavaScript and bind it to the event.
            Another important difference is that Visualforce is rendered on the server side.
            This means that a server roundtrip is required to update the property whereas, in LWC, rendering happens on the client-side.
            Indeed, it happens automatically when a JavaScript property value changes.
