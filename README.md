A collection of code examples to help you move from Visualforce to LWC. Each example shows a typical Visualforce pattern and its equivalent implementation in LWC. On each example, there's a link that takes you right to the Visualforce or LWC code in GitHub. Heavy usage of base components and features as Lightning Data Service.

## Installing the app using a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. Follow the steps in the [Quick Start: Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/quick-start-lightning-web-components/) Trailhead project. The steps include:

    - Enable Dev Hub in your Trailhead Playground
    - Install Salesforce CLI
    - Install Visual Studio Code
    - Install the Visual Studio Code Salesforce extensions

1. If you haven't already done so, authorize with your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

    ```
    sfdx auth:web:login -d -a myhuborg
    ```

1. Clone the visualforce-to-lwc repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/trailheadapps/visualforce-to-lwc
    cd visualforce-to-lwc
    ```

1. Create a scratch org and provide it with an alias (**visualforce-to-lwc** in the command below):

    ```
    sfdx force:org:create -s -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a visualforce-to-lwc
    ```

1. Push the app to your scratch org:

    ```
    sfdx force:source:push
    ```

1. Assign the **Visualforce_to_LWC** permission set to the default user:

    ```
    sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Visualforce_to_LWC
    ```

1. (Optional) Assign the `Walkthroughs` permission set to the default user.

    > Note: this will enable your user to use In-App Guidance Walkthroughs, allowing you to be taken through a guided tour of the sample app. The Walkthroughs permission set gets auto-created with In-App guidance activation.

    ```
    sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Walkthroughs
    ```

1. Import sample data:

    ```
    sfdx force:data:tree:import -p ./data/sample-data-plan.json
    ```

1. Open the scratch org:

    ```
    sfdx force:org:open
    ```

1. In **Setup**, under **Themes and Branding**, activate the **Visualforce to LWC** theme.

1. In App Launcher, click View all then select the **Visualforce to LWC** app.

1. Import Account and Contacts data:

    - Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trailheadapps/visualforce-to-lwc/master/data/Accounts-Contacts.csv) to acccess the **Accounts-Contacts.csv** file. Right click in the browser window and save the file as **Accounts-Contacts.csv**.
    - In **Setup**, type **Data Import** in the Quick Find box and click **Data Import Wizard**.
    - Click **Launch Wizard**.
    - Click **Accounts and Contacts**, and click **Add New Records**.
    - Select **Match Account by: Name & Site**.
    - Drag the **Accounts-Contacts.csv** file you just saved to the upload area.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Start Import**.

1. If you're attempting the [Quick Start](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/projects/quick-start-visualforce-to-lwc-sample-app) on Trailhead, this step is required, but otherwise, skip:

    - Go to **Setup > Users > Permission Sets**.
    - Click **Visualforce_to_LWC**.
    - Click **Manage Assignments**.
    - Check your user and click **Add Assignments**.

1. In **Setup**, under **Themes and Branding**, activate the **Visualforce to LWC** theme.

1. In App Launcher, click View all then select the **LWC** app.

## Optional Installation Instructions

This repository contains several files that are relevant if you want to integrate modern web development tooling to your Salesforce development processes, or to your continuous integration/continuous deployment processes.

### Code formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter used to ensure consistent formatting across your code base. To use Prettier with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.prettierignore](/.prettierignore) and [.prettierrc](/.prettierrc) files are provided as part of this repository to control the behavior of the Prettier formatter.

### Code linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular JavaScript linting tool used to identify stylistic errors and erroneous constructs. To use ESLint with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-lwc) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.eslintignore](/.eslintignore) file is provided as part of this repository to exclude specific files from the linting process in the context of Lighning Web Components development.

### Pre-commit hook

This repository also comes with a [package.json](./package.json) file that makes it easy to set up a pre-commit hook that enforces code formatting and linting by running Prettier and ESLint every time you `git commit` changes.

To set up the formatting and linting pre-commit hook:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you haven't already done so
1. Run `npm install` in your project's root folder to install the ESLint and Prettier modules (Note: Mac users should verify that Xcode command line tools are installed before running this command.)

> Note: This projects also contains [Jest](https://jestjs.io) tests for unit testing Lightning Web Components. If you experience errors regarding `deasync` when running `npm install` please check out the troubleshooting information in the [lwc-jest repository](https://github.com/salesforce/lwc-jest#troubleshooting-deasync-installation-errors).

Prettier and ESLint will now run automatically every time you commit changes. The commit will fail if linting errors are detected. You can also run the formatting and linting from the command line using the following commands (check out [package.json](./package.json) for the full list):

```
npm run lint:lwc
npm run prettier
```

## Code Tours

Code Tours are guided walkthroughs that will help you understand the app code better. To be able to run them, install the [CodeTour VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour).
